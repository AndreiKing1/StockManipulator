# StockManipulator
My project written in Java that has a graphic interface in which you see all of the products that the storage has, you can add new products or modify existing ones. To acces the storage you firstly need to register/login with your data. It has a history page with all the actions done by every user and at what time they did them. All the informations about users, products and history are stored in a SQLite database.
